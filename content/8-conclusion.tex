\section{Conclusion}

\quad In our paper, we laid the foundation for modelling American football as a hybrid system, which can help us think of more challenging modelling issues in multi-agent systems. In the time spent developing models, we made note of many important modeling subtleties, raised future questions for ways to more accurately model football, and found clever modelling simplifications. While considering all the possibilities and trying to fully convince ourselves, we even came across contradicting proofs revealing uncertain behavior with Mathematica 12.0.0. Even though we did not get to model football in its full complexity, much of the work we have done lays out the foundation and will serve as computational building blocks for later proofs. The approaches we took in this paper to develop our models can help us explore more advanced systems in the future.
