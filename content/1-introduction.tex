\quad American football lends itself to modelling in many ways and has clearly defined rules for what we will refer to as “safety” and “efficiency”. Much work has been done with making models for fútbol / soccer, especially with events like the RoboCup. But we seek to lay the groundwork for how we might approach similar problems of modelling, with American football (to which we refer to as “football”). \\

\subsection{American Football in a Nutshell}

\quad Football is played by two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field with goalposts at either end. The offense is the team that has possession of the ball. Their goal is to advance down the field by either running with or passing the ball. The defense is the team without possession of the ball. Their goal is to stop the advance of the offense. Football is played in increments. First, players line up along a line, facing each other. Then, the offense starts an “increment” by handing the ball to the quarterback. Action is continued until either the ball makes its way to the end of the field (or the endzone), or the player with the ball is stopped (often by being tackled to the ground). We will refer to a single increment as a “play”. \\ 
 
For the offensive team, there are three core roles which we will focus on: the offensive linemen (OL), quarterback (QB), and wide receiver (WR). A typical passing play in football involves the QB throwing the ball to the WR as the OL is protecting him from the defense. The QB may need to move around in order to avoid getting hit by the defense. However, the QB must avoid moving too quickly, because if he does, he will no longer be able to accurately pass to the WR. This is the prime challenge we seek to discuss in our model! But more on that later. \\ 
 
For the defensive team, there are two core roles which we will focus on: the defensive linemen (DL) and the linebacker (LB). The goal of the DL is to break past the OL in order to tackle the QB (often referred to as a “sack”) before he is able to pass the ball. The goal of the LB is to prevent the WR from catching the ball and to stop him after he catches it. One rule to note is that the LB is not allowed to touch the WR before he catches the ball, and can only indirectly influence his ability to catch the ball (block it, intercept it, etc). If he does, then it is considered a “pass interference” and counted as a violation against the defense. \\ 


\subsection{Summary of Terms}

Here are some terms that we will be using regularly throughout this proposal. Feel free to look back here if the terms or abbreviations get confusing. We also note some other specifics that may be necessary to know moving forward. Note that some of these positions are more nuanced in actual football, and that we restrict their responsibilities for the sake of a simpler analysis.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Player Roles}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{Quarterback (QB):} Offensive player responsible for passing the ball to WR’s
            \item \textbf{Wide Receiver (WR):} Offensive player responsible for catching the ball 
            \item \textbf{Offensive Linemen (OL):} Offensive player responsible for protecting the QB 
            \item \textbf{Defensive Lineman (DL):} Defensive player responsible for attacking the QB
            \item \textbf{Linebacker (LB):} Defensive player responsible for stopping the WR
        \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Logistics}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{Football Field:} 160ft wide x 300ft long, or 48.8m x 91.44m. The length is often measured in yards (100 yards, where 1 yard = 3ft). 
            \item \textbf{Play Clock:} The ball must be passed within 40 seconds
            \item \textbf{Line of Scrimmage:} The length-wise position of the ball at the start of a play
        \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{In-Game Actions}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{Pass Interference:} An illegal move where the LB touches the WR before he catches the ball 
            \item \textbf{Sack:} When the DL breaks past the OL and tackles the QB
            \item \textbf{Touchdown:} The Offensive team safely delivers the ball to the “endzone”, or past the 300ft on the field.

        \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Football Through The Lens of Hybrid Systems}

Our goal with this project is to explore how we might view football from the perspective of a hybrid system. A single play in football can be viewed as a collection of subproblems woven together to solve a greater goal of furthering the position of a ball. Some of the subproblems include passing, tackling, and quarterback movement with respect to linemen interactions. To get a better understanding of these subproblems as hybrid systems, we will describe each as a more traditional example of CPS we might see in a textbook.

Passing is very similar to how we might ensure the accuracy of a catapult or missile launching system (perhaps a bit of an extreme comparison). We want to ensure that, given a target, we are able to programmatically determine a path for our projectile to travel along in order to reach the target. This can start by first viewing how we might hit a static target, then a moving target, and finally a moving target as we (the catapult) are moving. Since we are reasoning about football, we are able to restrict the realm of possibility for how our target (WR) and catapult (WR) will move. 

Tackling can be reduced to the scenario of two robots following each other. If we consider our players as infinitesimal points, then we simply want to model their intersection as “tackling”. This relates heavily to the “Follow the Leader” lab, where we want to maintain a certain distance from a system in front of us. We will add an additional layer of complexity where we are able to accelerate again after a certain event-triggered control. In other words, once a certain event is triggered, our goal changes from maintaining distance to the leader, and instead intersecting the leader. Within the realm of football, this means that LB is allowed to tackle the WR after he catches the ball.

And finally, we have what our modelling will center around. With passing and tackling in mind, we then seek to ask, how we might be able to model the safety of the quarterback? There are many different things to consider with this. We could say that for the quarterback to be safe, we conservatively deem him to be the “leader” in the Follow the Leader lab. However, this fails since the goal of the follower IS to be “unsafe”. Furthermore, we cannot arbitrarily move backwards both because of the physical limitations of the field and the limitations of how far we can throw to the WR. We also cannot move at arbitrarily quick speeds, since that would impede our ability to pass the ball (in real football, the QB could choose to run, but this poses significant risk. Introducing this into our model would be introducing another strategy for the QB, as to when he should and should not violate his velocity restrictions, noting that violating it would inhibit his ability to pass). We must then leverage our ability to move side to side, the 40 second play clock, and the ability to pass to ensure the safety of our QB until the end of the play. There is also another layer of complexity since we now also have teammates that are there to protect us, and it is not wholly our responsibility as the QB to maintain our safety.

We will go on to further define some of the various subtleties and logic needed to describe and model a football play as a hybrid system. But let these comparisons and discussions serve to motivate your understanding of how one might view the game of football from the perspective of a hybrid system.
