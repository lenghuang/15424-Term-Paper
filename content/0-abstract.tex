American football lends itself to modelling in many ways and has clearly defined rules for what we will refer to as “safety” and “efficiency”. While it is not the most pressing issue in our society, modelling football can help us understand how to think of more important multi-agent systems. In the time spent developing models, we made note of many important modeling subtleties like the pass interference and maximum passing range. We also raised future questions for ways to more accurately model football with Quarterback controllers and probabilistic linemen. Finally, we found clever modelling simplifications that still preserve the safety and efficiency of the system. The approaches we took in this paper to develop our models can help us explore more advanced systems in the future.
